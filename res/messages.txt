After that mishap, Chip will rest in pieces.
Chalking that death up to user error.
Chip crumbled under pressure.
Chip died but his ghost is still my boo.
Chip just urned himself a place in the graveyard.
Chip took the wrong path. It was a dead end.
Chip wasn't up to the Challenge apparently.
Corpses aren’t very funny—they’re dead serious.
Cremation is Chip's last hope for a smoking body.
Did Chip have a will? A will is a dead giveaway.
Dying can really put a damper on your day.
Evaluation error. You failed to evaluate the hazards.
Fatal Error - Chip is dead
Getting killed can be injurious to Chip's health!
Great, now look what you did!
Hey, are you doing that on purpose?
I had grave doubts you could beat this level.
I won't go to Chip's funeral. I'm not a mourning person.
I won't tease you for dying. Speaking badly of the dead is a grave mistake.
I'll send flowers to Chip's funeral. It was on his bouquet list.
Neo, did you take the blue pill?
Send Chip to the morgue. Autopsies are a dying practice.
Syntax Error. You sinned with bad play and now you pay the tax.
That is not how you beat the well.
This is a game. Chip may be dead, but let’s put the fun back in funeral.
Time to call up the grave digger, Doug Grave.
Try not to do that so much next time.
Uh-oh: Chip performed a fatal operation and was terminated.
What’s a corpse’s favorite currency? Cryptocurrency.
Whoops... Let's try again.
Why don't ya watch where you're going?
Will you be a pallbearer to let Chip down one last time?
You made a grave mistake. You were not able to dig yourself out of it.
You must have been dying to get in the graveyard.
You're not a Bit Buster. You're Bit-Busted!

:time
Alert: The system has determined that you are either moving or thinking too slowly.
Buy yourself a clock book. It is about time.
Like your missing watch, you could never find the time.
Look, we don't have all the time in the world!
Mama said clock you out!
Next time sit on the timer so you will be on time.
That was like a belt of watches, a waist of time.
The timer went to therapy. It was just trying to wind down.
Time was not on your side.
Well, that was an untimely demise.
Were you eating a clock? That is very time consuming.
You annoyed the timer. It got ticked off.
You are not a hungry time traveler. You cannot go back four seconds.
You do know there's a time limit on this level, right?
Your shift is over. You clocked out.

:die time
The idea here is to win the level, not lose it!

:win
A winner is you!
Another level completed!
Bring on the next level.
Chip feels upgraded!
Chip, could you be any more crisp?
Congratulations!
Excellent! Most excellent!
Go Bit Buster!
Go Chip! Its Your Birthday!
Good work!
I am proud of you!
I knew you could do it!
I knew you had it in you.
I never doubted you for a moment.
I value our Friend-Chip!
Neo, you are the one!
Not bad, Chip. Not bad at all.
Now go for some record times!
Piece of cake!
That is how you do it!
That is what I am talking about!
That was fantastic. I take back half of what I said about you.
There is no stopping you!
Very well done!
Way to keep up the CHIPper attitude!
Well done!
Why can't you play like that more often?
You are in the zone!
You are making Chip look good!
You are putting on a clinic.
